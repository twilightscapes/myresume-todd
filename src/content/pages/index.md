A resume introduction shortens the most important aspects of your experience into a concise pitch to the hiring manager. So, write the other parts of your resume first. Then, decide which points from each part to include in your resume’s introduction paragraph, here.

<!-- <blockquote style=" text-align: left; border-radius: 12px;font-size: clamp(1.5rem, 1.4vw, 2.8rem); "><div style="padding: 2rem 10% 0px;">A plain text resume, also known as an ASCII resume, is a resume written in a plain text file format (.txt). This means it has no special formatting like colors, special lines or multiple columns.</div><div class="logofirst" style="text-align: right; margin: 2rem 30% 0px 0px; filter: none;"></div></blockquote> -->
